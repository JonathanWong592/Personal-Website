        <h3>About: </h3>
        <h3><span>
            Yelpify is a machine learning web application built with a react frontend and a flask backend. I made use of a 
            linear regression model to accurately predict a restaurant's "yelp rating" based off of user input including 
            review count, average review length, and average review age. After completing the application, I dockerized
            the application by creating two Dockerfiles to create images for the frontend and backend, which would then
            be served using Docker Compose. More can be found out here, https://github.com/JonathanWong592/ML-Docker

        <h3>1) <span>I created a linear regression model to predict Yelp ratings based off of data provided by Codecademy including business, photo, 
                    review, and user data. The model had a score of 83% based off of the features I tested with, which includes review count, average 
                    review length, and average review age. I saved the model to disk using joblib and is able to process input from the user accessing
                    the frontend, and output a result.  
        </span></h3>

        <h3>2) <span>I used docker to package my application making it easier for myself and other developers to deploy it 
                    without a problem. I created two docker images, one for the React frontend, and the other for the flask backend.
                    Both images were simulatenously launched by a docker compose file which hleped streamline the deployment process. 
        </span></h3>

        <h3>3) <span>The application is built off of an open source react and flask template paving the way for a more explicit implementation of my app.
                    I was able to clearly visualize the workings of how React and Flask communicated with eachother and send data back and forth with
                    the use of Flask-RESTPLUS. Knowing this, I modified the template to my liking and personzlied the apperance with a more Yelp app vibe.
