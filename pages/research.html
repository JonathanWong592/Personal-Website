        <h3>About: </h3>
        <h3><span>
            As an undergraduate researcher for the Severino Center for Technological Entrepreneurship, 
            I collaborated with computer science and business majors to gather and analyze social media 
            and business related data in an efficient manner. I developed Python scripts and utilized data 
            science libraries to efficiently extract, parse, and analyze relevant data from large datasets, 
            and saved them within our database directory. I attended weekly team meetings to address problems, 
            updates, or solutions, and kept note of tasks to be completed for the following week.

        <h3 id="tasks">Tasks:</h3>
        <h3>1) <span>Used textpreprocessing techniques and the levenshtein distance algorithm to determine if a given Instagram profile was a business or an influencer.
                    I utilized Nasdaq's company CSV file to find a relationship between the companies in the Nasdaq file and our scraped Instagram data. Each result
                    was either labeled as 0 or 1 and is to be used for future machine learning purposes, to make it easier to identify an Instagram business or influencer. 
        </span></h3>

        <h3>2) <span>Created an algorithm to efficiently download images stored on Crunchbase's server, and uniquely identify each one with a UUID
                     which was saved in a designated folder on our server. I used Pandas to easily query through a large CSV file to identify image links
                     which I then used to download these images using the request library.
        </span></h3>

        <h3>3) <span>Queried through a large Kickstarter dataset to find founder and company information necessary to discover relationships in
                    our Crunchbase dataset using the pandas library. This task involved querying through a MongoDB collection and finding the most important 
                    characteristics and features of a business and its founders alike.</span></h3>

        <h3>4) <span>Connected to MongoDB and extracted twitter specific information from a Crunchbase specific collection. I used string manipulation to extract the 
                    twitter user id from a user's profile URL which I then saved with a UUID (universally unique identifier) used to idenitfy a each specific user 
                    within the crunchbase collection.</span></h3>
